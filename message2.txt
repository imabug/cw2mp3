Samuel FB Morse was born on 27 April 1791 in Charlestown Massachusetts.
He invented the electric telegraph system with the help of Alfred Vail.
Morse had planned to transmit only numbers, and use a dictionary to look up
each word according to the number.
However, Alfred Vail expanded the code to include letters and special
characters.
The letters most commonly used in the English language were assigned the
shortest sequences.
Today, aeronautical charts show the morse ID of each VORTAC and NDB used for
in flight navigation.
